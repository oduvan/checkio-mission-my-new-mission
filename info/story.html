    <p>“You’re kidding right? All treasure is buried treasure! It wouldn’t be treasure otherwise!” Said

    <p>“Where did you get-”</p>

    <p>“Don’t ask questions. Just dig!” She hopped on the shovel and began digging furiously.</p>

    <p>“It’s the treasure!” Sofia was jumping up and down in excitement.</p>

    <p>“Easy enough. Let’s open this sucker up!” Sofia was shaking in excitement.</p>
